# Veist frontend development repository
### aka 'Veist art page'

To run the art page with React:
1. install the node package manager (npm)
2. clone the repository
3. navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <repo-name>
```
4. install dependencies (automatically from package.json file):
```
npm i
```
5. launch local server:
```
// for development:
npm run dev

// full build:
npm run build

// preview build
npm run preview
```

**Note**
The 'feed' sub-repository is an HTML-only prototype of the Veist 'feed' page. This is *not* built with React. It will be re-built with React in the future!
